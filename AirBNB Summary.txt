This project involves analyzing Airbnb data using Tableau to create a dashboard that highlights important trends and insights. The dataset consists of two sheets in an Excel file: the calendar sheet and the listings sheet containing around 3000 data for Airbnb rooms. The dashboard includes five visualizations: a bar graph showing the average price of Airbnb rooms with different numbers of rooms, a line graph displaying the revenue generated by Airbnb rooms month-wise in 2016, a map showing the average price of Airbnb rooms in different regions, a table showing the distinct count of bedrooms presently listed on Airbnb, and a bar graph showing the average price of Airbnb rooms based on the zipcode. These visualizations help stakeholders understand the data and make informed decisions. The project showcases the power of Tableau in visualizing complex data and presenting it in a user-friendly manner. The project requires Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader version 2020.4 or later.
